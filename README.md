Alternatively, if you wish to install LifeLearn on your own machine, you can do so by following the system installation instructions.

# System Installation

In order to install LifeLearn on your own local machine, you must first have Python 3 and Django installed.
  To install Python, follow the instructions here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  To install Django, follow the instructions here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/install/

Once Python and Django have been installed, you can start the server on Windows by navigating to the folder "LifeLearn/lifelearn" and running runserver.cmd. For all other operating systems, navigate to "LifeLearn/lifelearn" and run the following command:
```shell
	python manage.py runserver
```

# Operation
Once the server is running, you can access LifeLearn by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ in a web browser. From there, you can access either the Patient or Therapist dashboard by clicking on the appropriate buttons, at which point you will be able to interact with the system.
