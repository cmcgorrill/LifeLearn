# System Installation

In order to install LifeLearn on your own local machine, you must first have Python 3 and Django installed.
  To install Python, follow the instructions here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  To install Django, follow the instructions here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/install/

Once Python and Django have been installed, you can start the server on Windows by navigating to the folder "LifeLearn/lifelearn" and running runserver.cmd. For all other operating systems, navigate to "LifeLearn/lifelearn" and run the following command:
```shell
	python manage.py runserver
```

# Operation
Once the server is running, you can access LifeLearn by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ in a web browser. (***add further instructions after fleshing out backend***)
